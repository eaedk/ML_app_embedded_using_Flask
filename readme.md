# Structure
## File: app.py
This file must contain the Flask app. You will define the page endpoints, the logic that will be executed on each page of the Flask app and the html template to use for each endpoint.

## File: utils.py
This file must contain the functions or/and classes you have written to do preprocessing, feature engineering, post-processing, etc. You must copy and paste it into the file and import in functions and classes into the file `app.py` to use it to allow your ml models to work correctly.

## Folder: templates
This folder must contain the web page templates, the html files and the corresponding css files. You will define the appearance of the parts of your Flask app using web technologies `(html, css, js)`.

## Folder: ml
This folder must contain your ml models objects saved as files, also your transformation pipelines objects saved as files.

## Folder: venv
This file contain the virtual environment, every package you install to build you Flask app will be automatically saved into.
